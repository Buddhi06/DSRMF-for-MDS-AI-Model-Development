<div class="row">
 <p>Risk analysis process starts with selecting the risk analysis approach. <br><br>
    There are three applicable risk analysis approaches depending on which risk factor (threat, vulnerability and impact) is assessed first. <i><b>Threat-oriented, asset/impact-oriented and vulnerability-oriented </b></i> [1]. The choice of which approach to follow should be documented in the security risk management plan [1]. 
                </p>            
            </div>
        <div class="row">
    <div class="col-4" id ="c1" onclick="showDetails(event, 'detail1')">
       <center> <button  id="btn1">Threat-oriented approach</button></center>
       <div id="detail1" class="detail-box">
            The Threat-oriented approach starts with the identification of threat sources and threat events, and focuses on the development of threat scenarios [1], [2]. Vulnerabilities are identified in the context of threats and the impacts are identified based on adversary intent [2]. 
            <br>
            <button class="close-btn" onclick="closeDetails(event, 'detail1')">Close</button>
        </div>
    </div>
    
    <div class="col-4" id="c2" onclick="showDetails(event, 'detail2')">
        <center><button  id="btn2" >Asset/impact-oriented approach</button></center>
         <div id="detail2" class="detail-box">
            The Asset/impact-oriented approach starts with the identification of impacts or consequences or concerns and critical assets, and identifying threat events that could lead to and/or threat sources that could seek those impact or consequences [2]. There you need to perform a complete asset inventory and assess the potential impact if those assets are compromised. Then, identify vulnerabilities that could lead to those impacts and threat sources/events that might initiate exploits utilising those vulnerabilities [1]. 
            <br>
            <button class="close-btn" onclick="closeDetails(event, 'detail2')">Close</button>
        </div>
    </div>
    
     
    <div class="col-4" id="c3" onclick="showDetails(event, 'detail3')">
      <center><button  id="btn3" >Vulnerability-oriented approch</button></center>
      <div id="detail3" class="detail-box">
            The Vulnerability-oriented approach starts with a set of exploitable weaknesses/deficiencies or predisposing conditions and identifies threat events that cold exercise those vulnerabilities together with possible consequences of vulnerabilities being exercised [2]. 
            <br>
            <button class="close-btn" onclick="closeDetails(event, 'detail3')">Close</button>
        </div>
    </div>
</div>
<br>
<div class="row" id="RANstep1-1">
        <p>
            Each analysis approach takes into consideration the same risk factor (threat, vulnerability and impact) and contains the same set of risk assessment activities but in different order [2]. It is up to the manufacturer to decide which strategy to use, and the decision should be documented in the security risk management plan [1]. AAMI TIR 57 standard suggests to use the three approaches based on the following requirements:
        </p>
        <ol>
                        <li>If the target of the analysis is a complete system or if there are specific threats that should be addressed – <b>Threat-oriented approach</b></li>
                        <li>If the target of the analysis is a single device that will be used in the context of a larger system – <b> Asset/impact-oriented approach</b></li>
                        <li>During post-market deployment, i.e., when new risks may be learned through the exposure of new vulnerabilities – <b>Vulnerability-oriented approach</b></li>
                    </ol>
    </div>
<div class="row" id="selRAN">
<p>The framework uses the <b>asset/impact-oriented risk analysis approach</b>. It is based on the <b>STRIDE</b> threat modelling, i.e., an asset-centred threat modelling tool which is identified as a promising starting point for AI threat modelling by independent agencies like the <i>European Union Agency for Cybersecurity (ENISA) </i>.</p>
